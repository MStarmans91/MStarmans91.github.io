[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Martijn Starmans is an assistant professor at the Erasmus MC (Rotterdam, the Netherlands) leading the AI for Integrated Diagnostics (AIID) research line, with a dual appointment at the Biomedical Imaging Group Rotterdam (BIGR) (Dept. of Radiology \u0026amp; Nuclear Medicine) and PHANTOM group (Department of Pathology). His main research interest is the use of AI to improve the diagnostic work-up in oncology through integrated diagnostics, focussed on radiology (“radiomics”) and pathology (“pathomics”). Specifically, he develops multi-modal machine learning methods to simultanously co-learn from both modalities (“radiopathomics”), and automated machine learning and meta-learning methods to generalize these methods across clinial applications. He works on a variety of clinical applications (e.g. sarcoma, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, melanoma, cardiology, neuroendocrine tumors).\nCollaborations \u0026amp; Consortia\nMartijn is involved in various large European projects. He is leader of the platform work package of the Horizon 2020 EuCanImage consortium: Towards a European cancer imaging platform for enhanced Artificial Intelligence in oncology, and also work package leader of the Horizon 2021 EOSC4Cancer consortium. Additionally, he is external advisor of RadioVal, and member of the AI4HI AI Development working group, and of EUCAIM. He has been a visiting researcher of the BCN-AIM lab of Prof. Karim Lekadir at the University of Barcelona in 2023 for 4 months.\nMartijn is one of the initiators of the Sarcoma Artificial Intelligence (SAI) consortium (grant awarded), the Liver AI (LAI) consortium (grant awarded), and project lead of the Colorectal Liver Metastes AI (COLIMA) consortium (grant submitted). In these consortia, in total 51 clinical centers, companies, professional- and patient associations from 18 countries are united. He is also part of the Trustworthy AI for MRI ICAI LAB.\nFor a better overview on my projects, see https://bigr.nl/member/martijn/.\nPhD Degree\nMartijn obtained his PhD degree ‘‘cum laude’’ on February 1 2022 with his thesis titled Streamlined Quantitative Imaging Biomarker Development: Generalization of radiomics through automated machine learning. Following his passion to efficiently and automatically optimize routines, he developed an adaptive radiomics framework using automated machine learning, described in this paper. He collaborated with a large number of clinicians to develop radiomics biomarkers in a wide variety of clinical applications. His thesis was nominated for the Fredrik Philipsprijs 2023 for Best Dutch Radiology Thesis and made the top five.\nDownload my PhD Thesis.\nEducational activities\nMartijn has co-founded two courses in the MSc Technical Medicine, and is currently teaching two courses in the BSc MSC Technical Medicine and MSc Applied Physics of the TU Delft. Martijn also was part of the program committee and mentor in the first AFRICAI Summer School, and part of the first Rotterdam Radiology AI course organized by the Dutch Radiology Society. He enjoys working together with students and has so-far (co-)supervised 43 students in interships and thesis projects.\nDownload my (slightly outdated) resumé .\n","date":1702252800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1702300293,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Martijn Starmans is an assistant professor at the Erasmus MC (Rotterdam, the Netherlands) leading the AI for Integrated Diagnostics (AIID) research line, with a dual appointment at the Biomedical Imaging Group Rotterdam (BIGR) (Dept.","tags":null,"title":"Martijn P.

Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning, has made significant advances in developing predictive models from medical imaging. Currently, in medical imaging, AI models are manually constructed through a heuristic trial-and-error process, which suffers various drawbacks (e.g. time consuming, requiring expert knowledge, low reproducibility, sub-optimal performance).\nAim\nThe aim of this research is to overcome these drawback by developing AutoML methods to automatically optimize model construction per oncological application. You will work on a variety of oncological diseases, with a focus on rare cancers (e.g. sarcoma, primary liver cancer, colorectal cancer, melanoma, glioma), where in each application there is a classification task to be solved. You will have to design a search space of promising deep learning solutions (e.g. CNNs, transformers) and develop an AutoML algorithm to optimize model construction. We aim to make the optimization strategy model- and task-agnostic, such that various deep learning models can be tried, and other tasks besides segmentation such as classification can be used. The project is quite technical: however, the resulting biomarkers can have substantial clinical impact.\nRelated research:\nhttps://automl.org/automl/literature-on-neural-architecture-search https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2108.08618 https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2021.3067763 Supervisors\nMartijn Starmans Stefan Klein Feel free to mail me if you are interested in this project or want more information!\n","date":1676246400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676246400,"objectID":"e9bab618e99dff0c25b2db32180aef18","permalink":"https://MStarmans91.github.io/project/deepworc/","publishdate":"2023-02-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/deepworc/","section":"project","summary":"Exploting advances in neural architecture search to optimize model construction per oncological classification task","tags":["Deep Learning","AutoML","Radiomics","Technical"],"title":"Adaptive deep learning in oncology classification through automated machine learning (AutoML)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Background\nDifferential diagnosis of solid appearing liver lesions (groups of abnormal cells in the liver, either malignant or benign) based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most important challenges for abdominal radiologists. Based on their interpretation, patients are referred back with no need for follow-up or they may undergo further analysis with subsequent treatments including surgery or chemotherapy. In current practice, the differential diagnosis of liver lesions is based on subjective and qualitative assessment, relying vastly on the experience of the local radiologist. More objective and quantitative approaches are therefore urgently needed.\nAim\nThe aim of this research is to create a deep learning model for comprehensive liver tumor phenotyping based on MRI. We already have a database of 500 patients from various centers for you to start with four different liver tumors. You first task will be to extend this database by including more patients from the EMC with other liver lesion phenotypes. Using this dataset, you main task is to develop a multi-parametric MRI (e.g. T1, T2, DWI, contrast enhanced T1) deep learning model for the classification of these liver lesions. The main challenge is how to optimally combine the information from the different MRI sequences, while dealing with missing data and substantial heterogeneity. Optionally, we might also want to create a segmentation model, as this is something the radiologists would like to use in the clinic as well to quantify therapy response. You can focus on the more clinical aspects of the project in close collaboration with the radiologists, or the more technical aspects on how to construct such a model.\nRelated research:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.10.21261827 https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2108.08618 Supervisors\nMartijn Starmans Maarten Thomeer (Abdominal radiologist) Stefan Klein Feel free to mail me if you are interested in this project or want more information!\n","date":1676246400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676246400,"objectID":"0124f630fea243ef3ba21d72adab0d98","permalink":"https://MStarmans91.github.io/project/lai/","publishdate":"2023-02-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/lai/","section":"project","summary":"Develop deep learning methods for comprehensive MRI-based liver lesion phenotyping","tags":["Deep Learning","Clinical","Radiomics","Technical"],"title":"Diagnosis of solid appearing lesions based on MRI and deep learning","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Background\nAI has revolutionized the development of predictive models in oncology based on medical imaging. However, only a small fraction is actually used in clinical practice. This may be attributed to development focussing on performance only, which is not sufficient for healthcare. To overcome this gap, I recently worked on the FUTURE-AI guidelines for trustworthy and deployable AI in healthcare (see link 1 below). The first principle of the guidelines, Fairness, currently a hot topic, means that medical AI algorithms should maintain the same performance when applied to similarly situated individuals and subgroups, independent of e.g., sex, ethnicity, and age. While methods have been proposed to ensure algorithmic Fairness, this usually hurts performance.\nAim\nThe aim of this project is to develop a method to optimize the Fairness-performance trade-of of AI classification methods in medical imaging. You will develop generalizable methods, but we will focus on sarcoma on this project. The first step will be to evaluate the Fairness of current biomarkers in sarcoma. Second, you will have to implement various Fairness methods (see link 3 below) in our existing radiomics framework (see link 2 below) to evaluate how these impact Fairness and performance. Third, you will study how automated machine learning can be used to optimize the Fairness-performance trade-off of radiomics biomarkers, and which type of biomarkers are most suitable for this. In this project, we will collaborate with the BCN-AIM lab of the University of Barcelona.\nRelated research:\nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2109.09658 https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2108.08618 https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1810.01943 https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.11410 Supervisors\nMartijn Starmans Douwe Spaanderman Stefan Klein Feel free to mail me if you are interested in this project or want more information!\n","date":1676246400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676246400,"objectID":"041ab6ea8ac07930fe27111e45bea102","permalink":"https://MStarmans91.github.io/project/fairness/","publishdate":"2023-02-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fairness/","section":"project","summary":"Research how we can optimally trade off algorithmic Fairness and performance using automated machine learning","tags":["AutoML","Radiomics","Technical"],"title":"Optimizing the Fairness-performance trade-off of oncological radiomics biomarkers","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Background\nThe prognosis of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) is highly influenced by the so-called histopathological growth pattern (HGP), i.e. the interaction between the liver and tumor tissue. Patients with more aggressive growth patterns have a far worse prognosis and may benefit from preoperative neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the HGP can currently only be determined based on surgery and thus post-operatively. Our clinicians are therefore looking for a pre-operative alternative. Previously, we have already shown that histopathological characteristic of the primary tumor relate to the HGP (link 1 below).\nAim\nThe aim of this research is to create a deep learning model based on histopathology slides of the primary tumor to predict the CRLM HGP. We will take a two-fold approach: 1) automate the scoring of the characteristics that were previously found to be predictive. This will result in a highly explainable model, but performance might nog be ideal. 2) Take an agnostic approach, where you will use recent advances in AI models for whole slide image representation to train end-to-end models that determines CRLM HGPs directly from the primary tumour image. This project will be conducted in close collaboration with the Department of Surgery, Department of Pathology, TU Eindhoven, and GZA Antwerp.\nRelated research:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-022-09994-3 https://doi.org/10.1038/s41416-022-01859-7 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semcancer.2020.07.002 https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Chen_Scaling_Vision_Transformers_to_Gigapixel_Images_via_Hierarchical_Self-Supervised_Learning_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf Supervisors\nMartijn Starmans Zhen Qian (Department of Surgery) Mitko Veta (TU Eindhoven) Stefan Klein Feel free to mail me if you are interested in this project or want more information!\n","date":1676246400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676246400,"objectID":"fd210077a922a6e9546dfc45ba85ed37","permalink":"https://MStarmans91.github.io/project/crlmpathomics/","publishdate":"2023-02-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/crlmpathomics/","section":"project","summary":"Develop deep learning methods to predict histopathological growth patterns on primary tumor histopathology","tags":["Deep Learning","Clinical","Pathomics","Technical"],"title":"Preoperative prediction of colorectal liver metastases aggressiveness using pathomics","type":"project"},{"authors":["S.H.A.E.

Currently, many applications for radiomics in the diagnosis and prognosis of STT have been devised. However, at this time, an overview and assessment of the radiomics studies on STT has yet to be conducted.\nAs we are also developing radiomics methods for STT, it is of high priority to create an in-depth overview of the clinical applications radiomics has been used for in STT.

Voor deze tumoren zijn de longen de meest voorkomende locatie van metastase, wat optreedt in 20% van alle maligne weke delen. Het voorkomen van metastase is essentieel omdat de overlevingskans van de patiënt sterk afneemt. Tevens, wanneer er metastase optreedt, is het van groot belang dit zo snel mogelijk in kaart te brengen. Het identificeren van risicopatiënten voor long metastase is daarom essentieel voor het opstellen van het behandelplan en het inplannen van vervolg scans.\nOp dit moment is het moeilijk te voorspellen welke patiënten met een weke delen tumor een long metastase gaan doormaken. Het fenotype, locatie en tumorgraad kunnen al een hint geven. Zo hebben tumoren in de extremiteiten een grotere kans tot uitzaaiing naar de longen. Dit is hetzelfde geval bij hooggradige tumoren. Ook is de activiteit in de marginale zone van de resectie ook een indicatie voor kans op long metastase. Daarbij denken wij dat beeldkarakteristieken op MRI en/of CT een indicatie kunnen geven op de kans op long metastase.\nMet deze studie willen we kijken of we een radiomics model kunnen ontwikkelen die de kans op distale longmetastase kan voorspellen. Radiomics is een innovatieve methode waarbij moleculaire informatie wordt gekoppeld aan beeldkarakteristieken. Met deze techniek kan op basis van specifieke beeldkarakteristieken een voorspelling worden gedaan over de aard en progressie van de tumor. Door dit computermodel op basis van MRI- of CT-beelden te ‘leren’ welke patiënten risico lopen op een long metastase hopen we in de toekomst patiënten de meest optimale behandeling te geven.\nOnderzoeksvraag \u0026amp; Doel Het doel van dit onderzoek is om een radiomics model te ontwikkelen wat op basis van MRI- en/of CT-beelden kan voorspellen of een patiënt met een weke delen tumor risico loopt op een long metastase.\nOnderzoeksactiviteiten Gedeeltelijke database van patiënten is aanwezig, de resterende patiënten uit het EMC zijn reeds geselecteerd maar de gegevens moeten nog worden verzameld.

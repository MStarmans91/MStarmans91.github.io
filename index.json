On a new application, determining which method works best is tedious, challenging, and optimization generally leads to overfitting. Moreover, especially in rare diseases, the datasets are often simply too small for extensive optimization. Lastly, optimization is currently mostly done on the validation performance, while our goal is actually good generalization.\nAim\nThe aim of this project is to overcome the limits of optimization through two complementary approaches. First, we propose to learn from previous problems which solutions worked best instead of starting from scratch through meta-learning. Second, instead of optimizing for validation performance, we will create an ensemble of complementary solutions using Pareto front multi-objective optimization. To this end, we have collected twelve datasets of in total 2.500 patients on twelve different clinical applications (e.g. sarcoma, liver, prostate, brain, head and neck, neuroendocrine tumors) on which we previously successfully created individual classification models. Note that this project is quite technical and challenging.\nRelated research:\n https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1599245 https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05439  Supervisors\n Martijn Starmans Stefan Klein  Feel free to mail me if you are interested in this project or want more information!\n","date":1645660800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645660800,"objectID":"99b21e1a74176f5da231937f99091cc1","permalink":"https://MStarmans91.github.io/project/pareto/","publishdate":"2022-02-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/pareto/","section":"project","summary":"Overcoming the limits of model optimization for deep learning through metalearning, ensembling, and Pareto optimization","tags":["Deep Learning","AutoML","Technical"],"title":"AutoML For Deep Learning","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Background\nThe prognosis of colorectal liver metastases is highly influenced by the so-called histopathological growth pattern (HGP), i.e. the interaction between the liver and tumor tissue. Patients with more aggressive growth patterns have a far worse prognosis and may benefit from preoperative neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the HGP can currently only be determined based on surgery and thus post-operatively. Our clinicians are therefore looking for a pre-operative alternative.\nAim\nThe aim of this project is therefore to preoperatively predict the HGP based on computed tomography images using a combination of radiomics and deep learning. Previously, we have already distinguished pure HGPs (100% of one type) (see first paper below). Hence, using those methods, you should be able to quickly set a baseline for mixed HGPs using an already acquired and segmented multicenter database of 400 patients and an external validation set of about 200 patients we also acquired. However, we expect that this mixture is much more difficult to predict, and further technical advancements (e.g. multitask regression, combined detection and classification) are required, which will be your main task.\nRelated research:\n https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semcancer.2020.07.002 https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-019-07910-x https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-816176-0.00023-5 https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.11410  Supervisors\n Martijn Starmans Boris Galjart (Department of Surgery) Stefan Klein  Feel free to mail me if you are interested in this project or want more information!\n","date":1645660800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645660800,"objectID":"01d955b94f0290eee971e4670cb68fad","permalink":"https://MStarmans91.github.io/project/hgp/","publishdate":"2022-02-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/hgp/","section":"project","summary":"Preoperative prediction of colorectal liver metastases aggressiveness using radiomics and deep learning to select patients for chemotherapy","tags":["Deep Learning","Clinical","Radiomics","Technical"],"title":"Colorectal Liver Metastases Chemotherapy Prediction","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Background\nAt present, clinical staging of lymph nodes (LN) in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is usually performed on computed tomography (CT). In approximately 25% of the patients with MIBC and non-malignant locoregional small LNs prior to surgery, occult LN metastases are detected after radical cystectomy (RC) and pelvic LN dissection. Hence, there is an urgent clinical need to improve preoperative LN staging to better identify patients who may benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).\nAim\nThe aim of this project is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of pre-operative CT-based radiomics and deep learning to differentiate between pN+ and pN0 patients with MIBC. A multicenter dataset of about 250 patients has already been acquired, and all LNs have been segmented. The main challenge is that patients usually have a lot of LNs (mean: 44), but in the pN+ patients, only a handful are actually metastases, and we don’t know which, only how many. A naive radiomics approach has already been tested and did not yield positive results. We therefore propose to use a novel CNN strategy, in which we process each LN separately, combine them per patient in one loss, and trace the predictions back to the individual LNs to identify the metastases. Your goal will be to design and implement such a strategy. The resulting model could be used both for LN staging, and additionally to identify the metastases to guide treatment planning.\nRelated research:\n https://stichtingduos.nl/cirguidance/ (study from which the data originates) https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-17-1510  Supervisors\n Martijn Starmans Astrid van der Veldt (Department of Oncology) Stefan Klein  Feel free to mail me if you are interested in this project or want more information!\n","date":1645660800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645660800,"objectID":"e7d43895d369649f040efb350840130a","permalink":"https://MStarmans91.github.io/project/lymphnode/","publishdate":"2022-02-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/lymphnode/","section":"project","summary":"Optimization of pre-operative lymph node staging in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer using radiomics on computed tomography","tags":["Deep Learning","Clinical","Technical","Radiomics"],"title":"Lymph Node Staging","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Background\nSoft tissue tumors (STT) are a rare and complex group of tumors with over 100 different STT subtypes. A first step in any STT study is the segmentation, hence our radiologists are very eager for such a solution. Moreover, we previously successfully created STT classification models, which depend currently on manual segmentations. Automatic segmentation is however challenging due the STT rarity and their heterogeneity. Moreover, STT can invade other organs and occur anywhere in the body, making it difficult for deep learning to detect them.\nAim\nThe aim of this project is to create a deep learning model for the segmentation of STT by keeping the radiologist in the loop. To this end, we will make use of user-provided scribbles, i.e. rough indications of the tumor outlines, which will serve as input for the network. Additionally, the output of the network can be refined by again requesting a scribble from the clinician. You will start with a literature search on how to optimally make use of scribbles in this context. Using this pragmatic approach, with limited input from the clinician, we can provide automatic annotations for all kinds of STT. Moreover, we hope to extend this approach to brain tumors, where often refinements from the clinicians are also required.\nRelated research:\n https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2018.2791721 https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01152 https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.11410 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.109266  Supervisors\n Douwe Spaanderman (PhD student) Martijn Starmans Stefan Klein  Feel free to mail me if you are interested in this project or want more information!\n","date":1645660800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645660800,"objectID":"c03b4e0f99dae550d7c1da4c8553516f","permalink":"https://MStarmans91.github.io/project/scribble/","publishdate":"2022-02-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/scribble/","section":"project","summary":"Automatic segmentation of soft-tissue tumors on MRI with deep learning using scribble annotations and active learning","tags":["Deep Learning","Technical","Clinical"],"title":"Scribble Segmentation","type":"project"},{"authors":["Martijn P.

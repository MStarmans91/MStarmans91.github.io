[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Martijn Starmans is a postdoctoral researcher at the Biomedical Imaging Group of the Erasmus MC (Rotterdam, the Netherlands). His main research interest is the use of radiomics and deep learning to improve the diagnostic work-up in oncology. To this end, he focusses on exploiting automated machine learning and meta-learning to generalize methods across applications. To evaluate this generalization, he works on a variety of clinical applications (e.g. sarcoma, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, melanoma, cardiology, neuroendocrine tumors) with various clinicians.\nHe successfully co-applied for a grant from the Hanarth foundation on AI for the grading and phenotyping of soft-tissue tumors, and is currently co-supervising two PhD students. Through his research, he has gained ample experience with imaging infrastructure, e.g. DICOM, CTP, XNAT. As supporter of open science, he has released the software for all his studies open source (e.g. WORC) and released a large public database of 930 patients. As recognition, he was one of the winners of the Convergence Open Research Awards 2021.\nInternational collaborations\nMartijn is involved in various working groups and is leader of the platform work package of the Horizon 2020 EuCanImage consortium: Towards a European cancer imaging platform for enhanced Artificial Intelligence in oncology. In this context, he is currently visiting the AI in Medicine group of Prof. Dr. Karim Lekadir at the University of Barcelona. He is one of the initiators of the Sarcoma Artificial Intelligence (SAI) consortium (grant awarded), the Liver AI (LAI) consortium (grant submitted), and project lead of the Colorectal Liver Metastes AI (COLIMA) consortium (grant submitted). In these consortia, in total 51 clinical centers, companies, professional- and patient associations from 18 countries are united. Additionally, he is external advisor of RadioVal, member of the AI4HI AI Development working group, EUCAIM, and EOSC4Cancer.\nPhD Degree\nMartijn obtained his PhD degree ‘‘cum laude’’ on February 1 2022 with his thesis titled Streamlined Quantitative Imaging Biomarker Development: Generalization of radiomics through automated machine learning. Following his passion to efficiently and automatically optimize routines, he developed an adaptive radiomics framework using automated machine learning, described in this paper. He collaborated with a large number of clinicians to develop radiomics biomarkers in a wide variety of clinical applications.\nDownload my PhD Thesis.\nEducational activities\nMartijn has co-founded two courses in the MSc Technical Medicine, which he is still teaching plus a course in the BSc Technical Medicine. His tasks include preparing and giving lectures, developing and supervising programming sessions, and examination. He majorly enjoys working together with students and has (co-)supervised 37 students in interships and thesis projects.\nDownload my resumé.\n","date":1670680598,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1670682173,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Martijn Starmans is a postdoctoral researcher at the Biomedical Imaging Group of the Erasmus MC (Rotterdam, the Netherlands).

All STT subtypes significantly differ in their clinical behavior, aggressiveness, molecular background, and preferred treatments given. In order to guide personalized medicine, identifying biomarkers for patient outcomes is essential. The use of features in radiology imaging (radiomics) such as CT and MRI can be used to identify such biomarkers. These biomarkers have advantages as they can be retrieved from standard clinical practice, are non-invasive, and can be easily repeated to follow the patient in time.\nIn order to assess the quality of radiomics studies, Lambin et. al. (2017), have developed a quality measurement that evaluates radiomics studies methodology, of which a second version is almost ready. Currently, many applications for radiomics in the diagnosis and prognosis of STT have been devised. However, at this time, an overview and assessment of the radiomics studies on STT has yet to be conducted.\nAs we are also developing radiomics methods for STT, it is of high priority to create an in-depth overview of the clinical applications radiomics has been used for in STT. This can guide the field towards relevant clinical questions. Additionally, it is an opportunity to show the field what has already been achieved in recent years, and where the focus should be on.\nAim\nThe aim of this research is to qualitatively and quantitatively score radiomics studies in soft-tissue sarcoma.

Voor deze tumoren zijn de longen de meest voorkomende locatie van metastase, wat optreedt in 20% van alle maligne weke delen. Het voorkomen van metastase is essentieel omdat de overlevingskans van de patiënt sterk afneemt. Tevens, wanneer er metastase optreedt, is het van groot belang dit zo snel mogelijk in kaart te brengen. Het identificeren van risicopatiënten voor long metastase is daarom essentieel voor het opstellen van het behandelplan en het inplannen van vervolg scans.\nOp dit moment is het moeilijk te voorspellen welke patiënten met een weke delen tumor een long metastase gaan doormaken. Het fenotype, locatie en tumorgraad kunnen al een hint geven. Zo hebben tumoren in de extremiteiten een grotere kans tot uitzaaiing naar de longen. Dit is hetzelfde geval bij hooggradige tumoren. Ook is de activiteit in de marginale zone van de resectie ook een indicatie voor kans op long metastase. Daarbij denken wij dat beeldkarakteristieken op MRI en/of CT een indicatie kunnen geven op de kans op long metastase.\nMet deze studie willen we kijken of we een radiomics model kunnen ontwikkelen die de kans op distale longmetastase kan voorspellen. Radiomics is een innovatieve methode waarbij moleculaire informatie wordt gekoppeld aan beeldkarakteristieken. Met deze techniek kan op basis van specifieke beeldkarakteristieken een voorspelling worden gedaan over de aard en progressie van de tumor. Door dit computermodel op basis van MRI- of CT-beelden te ‘leren’ welke patiënten risico lopen op een long metastase hopen we in de toekomst patiënten de meest optimale behandeling te geven.\nOnderzoeksvraag \u0026amp; Doel Het doel van dit onderzoek is om een radiomics model te ontwikkelen wat op basis van MRI- en/of CT-beelden kan voorspellen of een patiënt met een weke delen tumor risico loopt op een long metastase.\nOnderzoeksactiviteiten Gedeeltelijke database van patiënten is aanwezig, de resterende patiënten uit het EMC zijn reeds geselecteerd maar de gegevens moeten nog worden verzameld.

On a new application, determining which method works best is tedious, challenging, and optimization generally leads to overfitting. Moreover, especially in rare diseases, the datasets are often simply too small for extensive optimization. Lastly, optimization is currently mostly done on the validation performance, while our goal is actually good generalization.\nAim\nThe aim of this project is to overcome the limits of optimization through two complementary approaches. First, we propose to learn from previous problems which solutions worked best instead of starting from scratch through meta-learning. Second, instead of optimizing for validation performance, we will create an ensemble of complementary solutions using Pareto front multi-objective optimization. To this end, we have collected twelve datasets of in total 2.500 patients on twelve different clinical applications (e.g. sarcoma, liver, prostate, brain, head and neck, neuroendocrine tumors) on which we previously successfully created individual classification models. Note that this project is quite technical and challenging.\nRelated research:\nhttps://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1599245 https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05439 Supervisors\nMartijn Starmans Stefan Klein Feel free to mail me if you are interested in this project or want more information!\n","date":1645660800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645660800,"objectID":"99b21e1a74176f5da231937f99091cc1","permalink":"https://MStarmans91.github.io/project/pareto/","publishdate":"2022-02-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/pareto/","section":"project","summary":"Overcoming the limits of model optimization for deep learning through metalearning, ensembling, and Pareto optimization","tags":["Deep Learning","AutoML","Technical"],"title":"AutoML For Deep Learning","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Background\nAt present, clinical staging of lymph nodes (LN) in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is usually performed on computed tomography (CT). In approximately 25% of the patients with MIBC and non-malignant locoregional small LNs prior to surgery, occult LN metastases are detected after radical cystectomy (RC) and pelvic LN dissection. Hence, there is an urgent clinical need to improve preoperative LN staging to better identify patients who may benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).\nAim\nThe aim of this project is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of pre-operative CT-based radiomics and deep learning to differentiate between pN+ and pN0 patients with MIBC. A multicenter dataset of about 250 patients has already been acquired, and all LNs have been segmented. The main challenge is that patients usually have a lot of LNs (mean: 44), but in the pN+ patients, only a handful are actually metastases, and we don’t know which, only how many. A naive radiomics approach has already been tested and did not yield positive results. We therefore propose to use a novel CNN strategy, in which we process each LN separately, combine them per patient in one loss, and trace the predictions back to the individual LNs to identify the metastases. Your goal will be to design and implement such a strategy. The resulting model could be used both for LN staging, and additionally to identify the metastases to guide treatment planning.\nRelated research:\nhttps://stichtingduos.nl/cirguidance/ (study from which the data originates) https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-17-1510 Supervisors\nMartijn Starmans Astrid van der Veldt (Department of Oncology) Stefan Klein Feel free to mail me if you are interested in this project or want more information!\n","date":1645660800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645660800,"objectID":"e7d43895d369649f040efb350840130a","permalink":"https://MStarmans91.github.io/project/lymphnode/","publishdate":"2022-02-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/lymphnode/","section":"project","summary":"Optimization of pre-operative lymph node staging in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer using radiomics on computed tomography","tags":["Deep Learning","Clinical","Technical","Radiomics"],"title":"Lymph Node Staging","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Background\nSoft tissue tumors (STT) are a rare and complex group of tumors with over 100 different STT subtypes. A first step in any STT study is the segmentation, hence our radiologists are very eager for such a solution. Moreover, we previously successfully created STT classification models, which depend currently on manual segmentations. Automatic segmentation is however challenging due the STT rarity and their heterogeneity. Moreover, STT can invade other organs and occur anywhere in the body, making it difficult for deep learning to detect them.\nAim\nThe aim of this project is to create a deep learning model for the segmentation of STT by keeping the radiologist in the loop. To this end, we will make use of user-provided scribbles, i.e. rough indications of the tumor outlines, which will serve as input for the network. Additionally, the output of the network can be refined by again requesting a scribble from the clinician. You will start with a literature search on how to optimally make use of scribbles in this context. Using this pragmatic approach, with limited input from the clinician, we can provide automatic annotations for all kinds of STT. Moreover, we hope to extend this approach to brain tumors, where often refinements from the clinicians are also required.\nRelated research:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2018.2791721 https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01152 https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.11410 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.109266 Supervisors\nDouwe Spaanderman (PhD student) Martijn Starmans Stefan Klein Feel free to mail me if you are interested in this project or want more information!\n","date":1645660800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645660800,"objectID":"c03b4e0f99dae550d7c1da4c8553516f","permalink":"https://MStarmans91.github.io/project/scribble/","publishdate":"2022-02-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/scribble/","section":"project","summary":"Automatic segmentation of soft-tissue tumors on MRI with deep learning using scribble annotations and active learning","tags":["Deep Learning","Technical","Clinical"],"title":"Scribble Segmentation","type":"project"},{"authors":["Martijn P.
